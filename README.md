# Amiry's simple React boilerplate
  This is my simple React setup.  
  Feel free to use this boilerplate as a basic foundation to any small React project.
  
  ### About
  Since web development technologies are advancing fast,  
  it's great to solidify your build tools knowledge every once in a while.  
  So I decided to create this boilerplate as a good practice of webpack and other build tools and methods.  
  This boilerplate will stay as simple as possible, while maintaining the latest features and a great developing experience.  
  I will create more boilerplates for other purposes, stay posted! :)
